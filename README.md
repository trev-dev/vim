My vimrc, written with vim9script.  I'm using the built-in package system.
Packages are version controlled/pinned by git submodules.  The goal is to use
the ftplugin/ and after/ftplugin directories for specific filetype configs
wherever possible.

Files:

- gvimrc: gvim stuff
- ideavimrc: copying/symlinking to jetbrains editors
- plugins.vim: plugin configuration and mappings
- vimrc: editor settings and related functions and mappings
